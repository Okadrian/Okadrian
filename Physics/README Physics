This is a place where i post code to help with all kind of physics. Such as Quantum mechanics, Classical Mechanics and relativity.


QuaAlg is a library for faster calculations in linear algebra and quantum mechanics

Relativity i put simulations regarding realtivity. Currently i only have a solar system model. That can compare Newtons predictions with Einsteins predictions.

Electro statics i have some functions to find simple green functions with random walks

Math methods is a place where i store important integrators for my physics simulations
