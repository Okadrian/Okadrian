My interest are mainly focused on physics and machine learning. I also find the intersection of machine learning with physics super interesting. 
Finding the most beautiful and simple solutions to a problem is a passion of mine. Also the art of pedagogy has always been a passion of mine. 
To formulate a problem or create information in an efficient way for people to learn, I think is one of the absolute most important things one can do.
