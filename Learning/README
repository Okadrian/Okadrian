Here i post programs i learned how to make and create through turtorials. I do not claim that the codes here are unique.
I do code here to learn new methods of tackeling problems. Here you can find AI, suddoku solver and so on.


Some of these program are among my very first and i have not bothered adding comments to make the code understanble.
I use this file mostly as an archive for myself.
